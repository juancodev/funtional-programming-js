# FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING WITH JAVASCRIPT

### This project is the result of course in Platzi.

We will learn the fundamentals of the functional programming paradigm with javascript. Keeping in mind that the language is multi-paradigm and allows us to choose as we like.

**_Key points_**:

- Declarative code.
- Pure functions.
- Types of memories: heap, stack.
- Shared state.
- Function composition.
- Closures.
- Currying.
- Higher Order Functions.
- First Class Functions.
